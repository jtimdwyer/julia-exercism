## Version compatibility
Julia 1.0 and 0.7 are the only supported Julia versions on Exercism.
For the most part, the test suites and solutions should be compatible to 0.6, but you will have to change `using Test` back to `using Base.Test` in the `runtests.jl` file.
Note that 0.7 and 1.0 are almost identical, except for deprecation warnings, which have all been removed in 1.0.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
